‚≠ê I am a Full Stack Web Developer, with a thirst for learning new technologies and challenging myself!
Most recently I learnt Python and now i'm currently exploring React Native and MongoDB.


### ‚≠ê My Journey to Web Development?

‚Ä¢ A very short one! 

‚Ä¢ Followed my passion of studying History to university, obtaining my BA degree...

‚Ä¢ Worked in a sustainably-focused clothing business for a few months afterwards, due to my love of all things green. One task being to build the website using WordPress, a technology I had not used before. Learning to use this and eventually building the website, sparked an interest in the tech industry...

‚Ä¢ Came across Lambda School - an online coding bootcamp, determined to try something completely new, interesting and challenging, I completed the pre-course work and loved every second of it!

‚Ä¢ 11 months later from starting the course, I have not looked back

‚Ä¢ I have since mastered React, JavaScript ES6, Node.js, HTML, CSS, Express.js, SQLite, WordPress, Jest, Redux, Python, RestAPI alongside core Computer Science topics such as Data Structures and Algorithms
